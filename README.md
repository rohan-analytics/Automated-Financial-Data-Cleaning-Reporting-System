Automated Financial Data Cleaning & Reporting System

Project Overview:
This project focuses on building an end-to-end automated financial reporting system that cleans raw transaction data, performs SQL-based analysis and generates an interactive Power BI dashboard for business insights.
The objective was to reduce manual reporting effort and create a workflow where new data can be refreshed and automatically updated in the dashboard.


Tools & Technologies:
Excel (Power Query) – Automated data cleaning
MySQL – Data analysis & querying
Power BI – Interactive dashboard & visualization
GitHub – Project documentation & version control


Project Workflow:
Raw Data → Power Query Cleaning → SQL Analysis → Power BI Dashboard
Raw financial transaction data collected
Cleaned and transformed using Power Query
Imported into SQL for business analysis
Connected to Power BI for dashboard creation
Refresh-based automated reporting workflow built


Data Cleaning & Preparation:
Performed using Excel Power Query:
Removed unnecessary columns
Cleaned text formatting and values
Standardized category names
Converted coded age values into meaningful groups
Created structured cleaned dataset
Power Query automates repetitive cleaning when new data is added and refreshed.


SQL Analysis:
Key analysis performed:
Total revenue and transaction count
Fraud transaction analysis
Category-wise revenue & transactions
Age group & gender spending insights
Fraud distribution by category
Reusable SQL queries were created for quick reporting.


Power BI Dashboard Features:
KPI Cards (Revenue, Transactions, Fraud count, Fraud %)
Category-wise revenue visualization
Fraud analysis by category
Age group & gender spending
Interactive filters
Clean professional layout


Automation Feature (Key Highlight):
This project demonstrates an automated reporting workflow:
New raw data added
Power Query automatically cleans data
SQL queries update analysis
Power BI dashboard refreshes instantly
This reduces manual effort and improves reporting efficiency.


Key Business Insights:
Transportation category generated highest revenue
18–25 age group contributed highest spending
Female customers showed slightly higher spending
Fraud rate ~1.2% overall
Highest fraud observed in sports & health categories
